    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Data Science</u></h2>
    <p>Data Science is like detective work for the digital age. It's about extracting insights and knowledge from data using techniques from statistics, machine learning, and computer science. Hereâ€™s a quick dive: <br>
        
        1. Data Collection: Gathering raw data from various sources like databases, APIs, and logs. <br>
        
        2. Data Cleaning: Tidying up the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors. <br>
        
        3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Getting to know the data by visualizing and summarizing its main characteristics. <br>
        
        4. Model Building: Using algorithms to create predictive models. <br>
        
        5. Evaluation: Testing the models to see how well they perform. <br>
        
        6. Deployment: Integrating the model into a real-world environment. <br>
        
        7. Monitoring: Ensuring the model continues to perform well over time. <br>
        
        Tools of the trade include Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, and pandas. Data Science transforms raw data into actionable insights, making it a cornerstone of modern decision-making.</p>
